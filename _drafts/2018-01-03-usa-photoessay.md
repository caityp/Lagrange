I've had enough of hotels in this short lifetime. Weekends traveling to games
with my college's soccer team, conferences, airports - all of them came along
with a hotel key and a room, each one identical to all the others.

Hotel chains, I assume, offer the same comfort and consistency that restaurant
chains do. A customer can visit one in Omaha, NE and expect the exact same thing
the got at the branch in Charleston, SC. Reassuring, I suppose. But when in Rome,
I, for one, would like to know without a doubt that I'm in Rome.

The texture of a place, it's uniqueness, it's odors and sensations are not to be
found in the bottled environment of a hotel room. How are we to know where we are
if every place looks exactly like the last?

In September 2014, I traveled from my family home in central Florida across the
country to Davis, California, to begin my graduate studies. Anything that would
fit in the back of my Honda CR-V came with me. Anything that did not was sold,
donated, or left behind (with the important exception of my 4-string banjo and
mandolin, which were lovingly shipped to meet me upon arriving).

Along the way, I made a resolution: **complete the 10-day road trip without once
booking into a hotel.** That meant a lot of camping in little-known state parks and
forest lands. It also meant an opportunity to reconnect with friends and family
scattered across the U.S., as well as appreciation for the hospitality of all-but-strangers
on my route.

### Savannah, GA

Only a few hours drive from my family home in Florida, Savannah had long called
to me for its air of history and mystery. I spent the afternoon walking a zigzag through every block in downtown before driving to Washington, D.C. to pick up an old college friend and spend the
night at her cousins'. A mini-reunion ensued the next day, when we drove halfway across Virginia to Blacksburg, the home town of another college friend. Our trio of former roommates and/or teammates sat in rocking chairs on front porches and yarned our way through several years of unshared history, so that we might feel ourselves to live in the same universe again.

### Versailles, KY

I then drove through West Virginia to the town of Versailles, outside of Lexington, Kentucky. My dad has a veterinary practice back home, and his first business partner and family had moved here
years ago. My family counts them among our oldest friends, having raised their children
alongside my brothers and I. I knew they had a small cattle farm in Versailles and had visited
them once with my mother, many years ago. They hosted me for two nights in their
18th century farmhouse, regaling me with family memories, hauling me along on the
day's farm operations, and sending me along with a jar of freshly canned tomato
salsa from their garden.
