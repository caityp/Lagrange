I've had enough of hotels in this short lifetime. Weekends traveling to games
with my college's soccer team, conferences, airports - all of them came along
with a hotel key and a room, each one identical to all the others.

Hotel chains, I assume, offer the same comfort and consistency that restaurant
chains do. A customer can visit one in Omaha, NE and expect the exact same thing
the got at the branch in Charleston, SC. Reassuring, I suppose. But when in Rome,
I, for one, would like to know without a doubt that I'm in Rome.

The texture of a place, it's uniqueness, it's odors and sensations are not to be
found in the bottled environment of a hotel room. How are we to know where we are
if every place looks exactly like the last?

In September 2014, I traveled from my family home in central Florida across the
country to Davis, California, to begin my graduate studies. Anything that would
fit in the back of my Honda CR-V came with me. Anything that did not was sold,
donated, or left behind (with the important exception of my 4-string banjo and
mandolin, which were lovingly shipped to meet me upon arriving).

Along the way, I made a resolution: **complete the 10-day road trip without once
booking into a hotel.** That meant a lot of camping in little-known state parks and
forest lands. It also meant an excuse to reconnect with friends and family
scattered across the U.S., and to appreciate the hospitality of all-but-strangers
on my route.

### Savannah, GA

Only a few hours drive from my family home in Florida, Savannah had long called
to me for its air of history and mystery. I spent the afternoon walking a zigzag through every block in downtown before driving to Washington, D.C. to pick up an old college friend and spend the
night at her cousins'. A mini-reunion ensued the next day, when we drove halfway across Virginia to Blacksburg, the home town of another college friend. Our trio of former roommates and/or teammates sat in rocking chairs on front porches and yarned our way through several years of unshared history, forked roads merging again.

### Versailles, KY

I then drove through West Virginia to the town of Versailles, outside of Lexington, Kentucky. My dad has a veterinary practice back home, and his first business partner and family had moved here
years ago. My family counts them among our oldest friends, having raised their children
alongside my brothers and I. They had a small cattle farm in Versailles and I had visited
them once with my mother what seemed like many years ago. They hosted me for two nights in their
18th century farmhouse, regaling me with family memories, hauling me along on the
day's farm operations, and sending me along with a jar of freshly canned tomato
salsa from their garden.

### Birdseye, IN

The proliferation of hotels and chain restaurants is a symptom of the homogenization of the country. My quest to avoid them took me to some unexpected corners of the country. Several hours of driving through Midwest corn country and the rumblings of hunger in my belly, I took a random interstate exit and ended up in Birdseye, an Indiana town so small it barely warrants a point on the map. It was Sunday, and the local burger joint and ice cream shop were closed. A flaking, red and white hand-painted sign informed me "Rabbits 4 sale." A deli tucked away in the back of an ancient hardware store supplied me with a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and a bag of potato chips to send me on my way.

In St. Louis, MO, I spent the night at the home of a friend's parents. Grabbed a frozen custard with her mom, pizza with her brother. Lolled in the pool. Eating cereal the next morning in their kitchen, surrogate mom quizzed me on my plans for lodging that night. Upon learning that I had none, she pulled from the crammed shelf above the toaster a bound booklet containing the names and addresses of the multitude of cousins and relatives that make up my friend's very Italian and very large family. She ran her name down the list and stopped at an entry. "Is Lawrence, Kansas, much out of your way? We have family there who could put you up for the night. Let me give them a call."

### Broken Bow, NE

From Kansas I cut north through Nebraska, aiming for Wyoming. I camped on state forest land just outside of Broken Bow, and moved on early the next day.

### Alliance, NE

A friend from home learned I was in Nebraska and sent a text, "You have to go see Carhenge!" It was just the sort of wacky thing that he would know about. I never knew it was there, would never have visited it otherwise, but what excuse did I have for missing it?

### Casper, WY

My dad hadn't spoken to Bill Allemand since he was a teenager. His father (my grandfather), Doc, and Bill had been hunting buddies since before he'd been born. Dad drove to the Allemand Ranch from Washington, Iowa, some summers to help with the cattle branding, and sure enough, when he called the Allemands out of the blue to tell them I was passing through Casper, they remembered Doc and his son. I was ushered into their home like the heiress to the throne. Proudly, the Allemands pointed out Casper's dinosaur bones, oil rigs, and uranium boxes. They drove me to the ranch, where it was 10 miles from the mailbox to the house. I was given the keys to an atv and escorted to where my grandfather and Bill always used to set up camp when out deer hunting. I was left there with my tent and the atv, and told to stay as long as I like.

Reassuring, I thought, that they didn't find it odd that I should want to camp there when there was a warm bed in Casper at my disposal. Reassuring that they didn't think I would mind the snakes and the solitude and the sound of the coyotes barking at dusk. I didn't. It was empty and beautiful, and I hiked the ridges and hollows and clambered over the boulders and through the pine woods where I imagined my grandfather might have seen a buck on a cold fall morning.

From Casper I cut south through the panhandle of Utah, camping again in the crisp, damp mountain forests outside of Salt Lake City. I woke early for the long drive ahead, stopping at an eccentric coffee shop in ___ for coffee and breakfast before pointing my nose towards Highway 50 and a straight shot through the desert.

Made it to Davis just in time for pumpkin season.
